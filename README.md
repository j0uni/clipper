# clipper
Here's one simple example that is compiling on gcc.

Build it with command:
g++ clipper.cpp main.cpp -o test

You need the clipper-library, download from here: http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php

It should output:

solution size = 1
0 = 175, 200
1 = 150, 200
2 = 150, 100
3 = 175, 100
